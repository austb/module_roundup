**puppetlabs-catalog_preview-2.2.0**

Module providing catalog preview and migration features

##2016-08-02 - Release 2.2.0
### Summary

This release includes new features as well as bug fixes.

The overview data model now contains more information. It used to only contain the top 10 nodes based on an issue count.
Now, the overview data model contains information about all nodes the overview is based on and with more details per node
in the form of number of errors, warning, and catalog differences. This information is now used to better order the output
as well as being easier to consume by custom post-processing and presentation logic.

Attempting to use a node for which there was no available fact-set caused an error that did not indicate what the real problem was.
Now, instead, deactivated or non existing nodes will be skipped. This supports the use case when a compilation is requested
where the list of nodes to compile for was generated from a list of certificates (which may contain deactivated nodes).

There were errors in the calculation and presentation of issue counts where the same problem could be counted multiple times.
This is now corrected.

Catalog preview could not compute the difference between resources that used an Integer as resource title. This is now fixed.
